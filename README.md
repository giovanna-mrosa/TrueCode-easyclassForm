# TrueCode-easyclassForm

# Project

An animated login and registration form with a smooth sliding animation just by using HTML and CSS and little bit of JavaScript, also an awesome carousel that we're gonna have beside the form using only vanilla JavaScript. In addition to this, I made the login page completely responsive on any device, so it stays responsive no matter what the size of the device is.
Now this sign in & sign up form page leads to a really fun project that covers a bunch of css technologies ( flexbox, grid, animations ... ), and also a lot of Javascript concepts ( arrow functions, forEach, template literals ... )
